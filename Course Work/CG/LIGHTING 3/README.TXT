README for the Lighting 3 Program

This program demonstrates a bunch of things. The text has properties that
make it resemble chome. There are two positional colored lights and two
white lights. Note how the red and blue lights blend to make some purple
highlights. Also note that the light is not impeded by objects-the light
shines on all letters equally, even though the light would be blocked
if this were a real model. OpenGL doesn't do ray-tracing, but you can
do it yourself.

The scene is animated, so try the following keys:
HOME: Resets viewpoint to initial values (animation keeps going)
SHIFT-HOME: reset viewpoint & clear movement vectors
5: Clear movement vectors
Up/Down Arrows: change velocity in Z (if shifted, change rotation)
Left/Right Arrows: change velocity in X (if shifted, change rotation)
Plus/Minus: change velocity in Y (if shifted, change rotation)
ESC: Exit animation
